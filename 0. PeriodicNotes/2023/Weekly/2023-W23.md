# Review
- #personal-brand/wot-sharing-meeting The matter of PPT makes me feel that we should not put the buffer of some important things on weekends, because weekends are sometimes very difficult to predict, if it is important enough, then prepare well on weekdays, on the contrary, those unimportant things can be done on weekends. ^erq5ey
